Hello,

My name is Houda, and I am currently a student at Masdar Institute. I have a strong interest in service management systems, particularly OpenSRM, and I am eager to learn more about how it can be applied in various operational contexts. I'm excited to explore its features and contribute to discussions or projects related to this platform.

Looking forward to working with you!

Best regards,
Houda
